#
# ELF autoload config file
# -------------------------
#
# Loader looks for this config file (ps5_lua_loader/autoload.txt) in this priority order:
# - USB drives,
# - /data directory,
# - lua game savedata directory.
#
# This file should contain the names of ELF payloads that need to be sent.
# (one ELF file name per line)
# Lines starting with ! will be treated as sleep commands (e.g., !1000 will sleep for 1000ms).
#
# Don't include elf_loader payload here!
